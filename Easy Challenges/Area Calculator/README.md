# Challange :  Area Calculator

## Description
**We have a dog that likes to bark.  We need to wake up if the dog is barking at night!**

1. Write a method named area with one double parameter named radius.

2. The method needs to return a double value that represents the area of a circle.

3. If the parameter radius is negative then return -1.0 to represent an invalid value.

4. Write another overloaded method with 2 parameters x and y (both doubles), where x and y represent the sides of a rectangle.

5. The method needs to return an area of a rectangle.

6. If either or both parameters is/are a negative return -1.0 to indicate an invalid value.

7. For formulas and PI value please check the note below.

## Note
- *The formula for calculating the area of a rectangle is x * y*
- *The formula for calculating a circle area is radius * radius * PI*
- *For PI use a constant from Math class e.g. Math.PI*
- *Do not add a  main method to solution code*
